# Reveal.js Presentation Template for Next.js

This repo is a useful starting point for creating a presentation with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and Next.js. It's _fairly_ unopinionated about how you build the presentation, however, provides support for tailwind.css out of the box since it sits well with Reveal's design patterns, however, it is not necessary.

## Installation

The repo is set up to go immediately:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies (e.g. `pnpm install`)

## Usage

See the [Reveal Docs](https://revealjs.com) for the full API. Below is a simple summary to get you started.

### Lazy loading

Reveal.js has a lot of browser-specific features that are not supported on the server. As such, to use the package in next.js, you need to lazy load the reveal.js using `next/dynamic`. With the app router, this means creating an intermediary client component "`<Presentation>`" to load `<RevealSlides>` since the `dynamic` function cannot be run in a server component (e.g. `page.tsx`).

If you were using something without SSR (e.g. Vite), you could use the `<RevealSlides>` component directly.

### Creating slides

Reveal converts all `section` elements into slides. It's as simple as:

```html
<section>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</section>
```

### Vertical slides

You can create a vertical stack of slides as follows:

```html
<section>
  <section>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </section>
</section>
```

### Fragments

Fragments are revealed one at a time _in the order they appear in the document_.

```html
<section>
  <h1>hello world</h1>
  <p className="fragment">I appear first</p>
  <p className="fragment">I appear second</p>
  <p className="fragment">I appear third</p>
</section>
```

You can also use `display: none` to hide a fragment visually but keep it in the slide order. This is useful when you want to orchestrate React state using the same navigation controls as the rest of the presentation (e.g. arrow keys).

```html
<section>
  <h1>hello world</h1>
  <p className="fragment hidden">I exist only in the timeline</p>
  <p className="fragment">Visually, I appear first</p>
</section>
```

### Slide transitions

Slide transitions are controlled by the `transition` option in the Reveal config _OR_ in the `data-transition` attribute on the slide element. See the [docs](https://revealjs.com/transitions/) for more info.

### Slide State

This repo captures the following events from Reveal.js and makes them available to the app via the `useSlides` hook:

- `slidechanged`
- `fragmentshown`
- `fragmenthidden`
- `overviewshown`
- `overviewhidden`

The return type of `useSlides` is:

```ts
type SlideState = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  f: number;
  overview: boolean;
  paused: boolean;
};
```

This is useful for co-ordinating state around slide and fragment visibility.

> Similarly, the `useTheme` and `useConfig` hooks can be used to update the theme and config respectively.

### Slide Controls

The `useSlideControls` hook provides a set of functions to allow you you directly control the position of the presentation. These are:

- `next()`
- `prev()`
- `first()`
- `last()`
- `go({ x, y, f })`

### A note on styling

Reveal _requires_ importing its CSS (`reveal.js/dist/reveal.css`). This applies styles for page layouts, but also many different elements (such as `h{1-6}` and `p`) to provide sensible defaults to the built-in themes. To override their styles you have to either:

1. Use `!important` in your css
2. Use React's `style` prop
3. Use Tailwind's `!important` modifier in `tailwind.config.ts` (on by default here)
